C++ Vending Machine code

Vending Machine description : http://gse.ufsc.br/bezerra/?page_id=2175

This project aims to implement a vending machine on STM32F429 board

It's only included the files that implement the vending machine. The files that configure the low hardware of the STM32F429 were not added here because its size is large and they can be found in or generate by softwares that configure the board. In our case, these configuration hardware codes were generated by STMCubeMX.
